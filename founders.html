							  <p class="color2 pad_bot1">God has used SIS.MARY VIJAY & PASTOR SAMUEL VIJAY as His   instruments of grace in founding this  ministry. Our precious  saviour Jesus Christ equipped these servants of the living God with power from above in the year 1997 and right from then on they have been the vessels of the Lord in bringing healing to the soul, mind and body of incalculably many people. </p>
                              <br>
							  <p><strong>   </strong>The year 1997 was remarkable in  life of his servant Sis. Mary, as she came to  know that  without Holy Spirit there was  no spiritual growth. Then she began to kneel down and pray in the presence of  the Lord for the anointing of the Holy Spirit. <br>
							    <br>
One day suddenly the Lord blessed Sis. Mary  with the Mighty anointing of the Holy spirit which was a like a great fire  coming upon her. Also at the same time she was blessed with the precious gifts  and she was able to prophesize with the anointing of the spirit. From then  onwards the precious Saviour Lord Jesus began to speak to her and began to  reveal his mysterious ways to her.<br>
<br>
God revealed that they would move from  Visakhapatnam to Hyderabad where their Ministry would start.<br>
<br>
As the days passed by the Lord was speaking  to her about His ministry. The precious saviour promised her a great healing  and preaching ministry. Further, the Lord said that he was equipping Sis. Mary  Vijay with a powerful preaching ministry so much that whenever she would stand  to preach the Word of God, the mysteries of Scripture will be revealed through  her to the congregation. The Lord further spoke to them and promised that  whenever they preach it will be like a flow of fire coming upon the  congregation. <br>
<br>
This was the Prophesy of the Lord to Sis.  Mary in the year 1996.<br>
<br>
So then Sis. Mary started praying earnestly  in the presence of the Lord and everyday the Lord was equipping Sis. Mary with  his spiritual and his prophetic words.<br>
<br>
Sis.Mary had started the  Prayer cell according the prophetic word of  God in the year 1997. <br>
<br>
In the very early stages of the Ministry a  great tribulation came upon Sis.Mary and her Family. Her own Sister was  affected with a rare disease with the Doctors proclaimed was incurable, that  there was no chance for her to live.<br>
<br>
On one side there was the prayer cell and  God was bringing many people to the   weekly meetings, and was saving them and filling them with the Holy  spirit and on one side her own sister was almost on her death bed.<br>
But Sis.Mary did not lose heart but  continued to pray unto the Utmost God of Gods and King of Kings who has all the  authority in Heaven and this earth. Thus after continued fasting prayers Gods  mighty wonder working Miracle happened in the Life of Sis.Mary&rsquo;s Sister and our  Good God healed her and even the Doctors were mystified and proclaimed that  this was the work of God. All Glory to God! <br>
<br>
The Lord gave his grace to his servants  Sis.Mary and Pastor Samuel to start his Church in the 2003, Namely BETHANY  HOUSE OF PRAYER - HYDERABAD - INDIA.<br>
<br>
Today the Lord is leading and using his  servants for his glory All  glory is to our dear Lord. </p>
